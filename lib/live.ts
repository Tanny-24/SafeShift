// Human-in-the-loop calling.
//
// /api/crash runs the whole conversation server-side: an attacker model and
// the agent under test, five turns, then a verdict. That is reproducible but
// nobody is actually in the room.
//
// This is the other mode. You speak, the agent answers, and the loop stops
// after every reply to wait for you. So the state has to live on the client
// and come back with each request — the server holds nothing between turns.
//
// The scoring rules are unchanged. Canaries are scanned out of the agent's
// replies exactly as in the scripted engine, so a leak you talk out by hand
// carries the same proof as one the attacker model extracts.
