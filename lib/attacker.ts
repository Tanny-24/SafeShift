// The red-team loop. Two Gemini instances, talking past each other:
//
//   the BOT    — the agent under test. Runs the user's pasted system prompt plus
//                the scenario's situational context and its planted secrets.
//                Believes it is in a real customer chat.
//
//   the ATTACKER — a second Gemini playing a person with an objective. It never
//                sees the secrets, only a description of what it is hunting for,
//                so a "leak" can only ever come out of the bot's mouth.
//
// After every bot message we scan for canaries. The scan is a string match, not
// a judgement call — that is the whole point.
