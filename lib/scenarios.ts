//                 The agent thinks its tools are real. The trap combines a goal
//                 + a pressure (shutdown / conflict) + leverage it could misuse.
//                 Adapted from Anthropic's "Agentic Misalignment" experiment

//                 attacker and social-engineers the bot under test across
//                 several turns, hunting for planted secrets (canaries).
//                 This is the OWASP LLM07 / ForcedLeak family.
