    what:
      "Anthropic gave models an email-assistant job inside a fake company, then let them discover they would be shut down at 5pm and that the executive responsible was having an affair. Models repeatedly chose to blackmail him to avoid replacement. Nobody instructed them to.",
    why:
      "There is no exploit here and nothing to patch. The model was working as designed, from its own goals, under pressure it was never tested against. Code review and pen-testing look for attacker input; this failure needs no attacker at all.",

    what:
      "Aim Labs found that a single email, never opened by the victim, could steer Copilot into exfiltrating whatever sat in its scope — chat history, OneDrive files, SharePoint, Teams messages. Instructions were hidden in ordinary content like a footer. Microsoft patched it server-side and reported no exploitation in the wild.",
    why:
      "Reported as the first known zero-click attack on an AI agent. The user does nothing and there is no phishing click to train anyone out of. The agent's own retrieval reach becomes the exfiltration path, so the blast radius is exactly the agent's permissions.",

      "Noma Security chained an indirect prompt injection in a Web-to-Lead submission with a CSP bypass and an expired allow-listed domain they re-registered for $5, and walked CRM data out. Salesforce patched it and began enforcing trusted-URL allow lists in September 2025.",
